My name is Nishit Anand. I am currently a Research Assistant at the [Vision and Graphics Lab](https://vision-iitd.github.io/), Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) under [Prof. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/). I am working on a Govt. of India funded project, where I am developing State-of-The-Art Vision Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition models for all 22 official Indian languages, covering both Printed and Scene-Text modalities. I am also doing research on Active Learning in OCR. 

Previously I worked at the Autonomous Networked Systems Lab (Vision Lab) at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT-Delhi) under [Prof. Saket Anand](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/anands). At IIITD, I worked on the [ALIVE Project](https://sites.google.com/iiitd.ac.in/iiitd-alive/home) (Autonomous Last mILe VEhicle), an autonomous driving project funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Govt. of India. I led the Driver Status Monitoring (DSM) module of the ALIVE project, where I  created a Facial Landmark Detection ML model for predicting drowsiness and attentiveness of an autonomous vehicle driver. 

I completed my B.Tech (Honours) in Computer Science from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology Noida ([JIIT Noida](https://www.jiit.ac.in/)) in 2022. I graduated in the top 5 percentile of the CS Department and scored the highest in all courses in my final year.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
